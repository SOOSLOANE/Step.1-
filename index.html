  <h2>WEB?</h2>
  <p>
  The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is the world's dominant software platform.[1]<br>
  It is an information space where documents and other web resources can be accessed through the Internet<br>
  using a web browser.[2] The Web has changed people's lives immeasurably.[3][4][5] It is the primary tool<br>
  billions of people worldwide use to interact on the Internet.[6]<br>
  Web resources may be any type of downloadable media. Web pages are documents interconnected by hypertext<br>
  links formatted in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). The HTML syntax displays embedded hyperlinks with<br>
  URLs, which permits users to navigate to other web resources. In addition to text, web pages may contain<br>
  references to images, video, audio, and software components, which are either displayed or internally<br>
  executed in the user's web browser to render pages or streams of multimedia content. Web applications are<br>
  web pages that function as application software.
